How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It made it very clear which lines were new and which were old narrowing 
    things down and making the task easier and faster. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Enables you to find things faster 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pro's: Only have meainingful comits (one per logical change)
    Con's: Can forget to comit, which is very, very bad.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    With Git any number of files can change between commit's, it is therefore 
    neccessary to save each changed file. With others, such as Google Docs, it
    is likely only one fiule has changed, therefore it is only neccessary to 
    save a single file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Good for finding changes between features

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Makes it easier to reel back, so no issues taking a jump.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Java and Android Dev :-)
