When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working remotely or when working as part of a group collaboration 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If someone else has been working on the project you'd want to ensure
    thier changes will not conflict with yours

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork is where GitHub clones a repository. It is useful so that others 
    can work on thier own versions of the code while keeping a reference back 
    to the original. Changes other people make to their fork do not affect 
    the original
    
    A clone is a copy of a directory or repository that contains its change 
    history.
        
    A branch is a label for a commit. Branches are useful for a host of reasons
    such as colaberative working, bug fixing, feature testing etc. When work
    on a branch is completed it is normally merged back eith the main production
    branch which is normally called the master branch 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can stay fairly up to date with the on-line repository and its commits.
    It also gives you a solid starting point when for you to start a local 
    branch of changes ready for submission to the on-line repository.
